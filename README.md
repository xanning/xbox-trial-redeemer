# xbox-trial-redeemer
Redeems XGPC codes in Selenium. Holy shit??? IS THIS EVEN CODEABLE?!?!?!??!

# Buggy
Yeah, this is made in Selenium for me to only use. I am quitting making alts or community even so here's the code.

This code has lot of bugs, NO error handling whatsoever, every account creation you'll get 10x captchas

If you wanna take this as base and make changes add capsolver etc, here.

# Known bugs
If a VCC is denied, it doesn't replace with a new one. Waits for user to put a new one in.

If any error modal happens after clicking final redeem button, it doesnt know what to do. Either account is void or you need to click that yourself

Waiting systems are on sleep functions. all modified according to my internet speed.

Anything unexpected happens? Woops, it'll crash 


# How to use
Install the requirements (I dont know what those are, look at the imports and figure it out)

Set your path to chromedriver on line 31, 33 and 34 (One should be it but i dont remember lmfao)

Put your codes in codes.txt like 1 code each line

Put your vcc's in ccs.txt in number|MM|YY|CVV format

Have the names.txt on the same folder as the script

Put your webhook on line 43


# The future of this
If you want to, make pull requests, i'll maybe merge just for user sake. Forking it yourself and making a better one is a way better option though.

I *will* fork and modify this so it doesn't create outlooks, just waits for you to login with one, and make it more user friendly *at some point*
